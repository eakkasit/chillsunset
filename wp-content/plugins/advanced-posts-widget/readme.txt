This widget was built not only with end-users in mind, but also plugin developers.  Almost every aspect of this widget is extensible through filters and action hooks.  You can even add your own form fields to the widget form!

* Need to remove a field from the widget form?  Not a problem!  Every field is passed through its own filter for easy customization.
* Need to modify the output of the widget?  Easy!  The output is passed through numerous filters, allowing you to customize the post list to meet your project's requirements.
